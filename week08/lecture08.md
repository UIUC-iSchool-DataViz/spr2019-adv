## Software Frameworks II

 * Deploying a web-based framework
   * Github pages
   * Deploying vega-lite
   * LessCSS
   * Putting data next to it
 * Exploring using data.world

---

## Github Pages

Last time, we set up a development environment using Visual Studio Code.

We will use that environment today to deploy a website using vega-lite, and
proceed from there to developing a more complete project.

## Example Repository

## Next Steps

1. Fork and clone repository
2. Port your 
3. Identify your dataset
4. Import your dataset
5. Import your declaration

## Git Quick Tutorial

These are the major commands you will need to know:

 * `git add`
 * `git commit`
 * `git pull`
 * `git push`

## Exploring data.world

I have created a sample project about Chicago libraries.

https://data.world/matthewturk/chicago-library-data

As groups today we will explore this data.

---

## Library Data

The library data is spread across files, so we will need to regularize it and
export to a format we can support and visualize.

There are two values for each library:

  * Circulation
  * Visitors

What can we do with this data?

## RevealJS

RevealJS is a mechanism for transforming markdown and other HTML elements into
a slideshow.

All of these slides are written in RevealJS.

## Your Final Project

Your final project will be due our last day of class.  It is to be a webpage,
built using RevealJS, that includes both pre-generated and dynamic
visualizations.

You must take into account the licensing of data, licensing of images, and you
will be presenting to the class.

Let's find some datasets.
